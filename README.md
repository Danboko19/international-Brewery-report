# OBSERVATION

Comparing the profit by region i discovered the maximum sales came through the francophone country but if we are to go with the countries mumber i believe the most sales came through the francophone countries per eac sles.
I also observed that senegal is the countries with highest beer comsumption rate out of the five countries .
Also observed that porfit were dropping same as sales made as the years go bye.
Also the highest most selling product in Nigeria 'hero' beer and 'eager lager' is sells the most in southsouth Nigeria 



# RECOMMENDATION

I recommend that there should increase in supply to the francophone countries because they brought in the highest expecially senegal.

I will like to bring the attention of the board to drop in sales and profit as the year go bye as 2017 generated the most profit and 2019 generated the least, therefore a paln should be made towards this . 

I recommend that the company should reduce the production 'budweiser','castle lite' as the purchase of this product are low and increase the production of 'eagle lager' and 'hero'.
